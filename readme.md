## Multiple Image Scroll Effect

![Multi](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/aayushchouhan24/sheryjs@main/media/multi.gif)

All 3D effects in this library supports multi image with wave scroll effect which increases the productivity and usability of effect, offering a unique and interactive experience.

To use this you just need to give a div with images you want.

```html
<div class="images">
  <img src="image1" />
  <img src="image2" />
  <img src="image3" />
</div>
```

```javascript
Shery.imageEffect(".images", {
  style: 3,
  /*optional parameters
  these parameter dose not applies to custom scroll trigger callback */
  scrollSnapping: true,
  scrollSpeed: 6,
  touchSpeed: 6,
  damping: 7,
});
```

### Custom Scroll Trigger Callback

To implement the GSAP ScrollTrigger or any other scroll library, as well as vanilla JavaScript and to achieve them full potential of Multiple Image Scroll Effect, you can define your custom scroll behavior using the callback parameter `slideStyle` within the **Multiple Image Scroll Effect**.

To define your specific scroll behavior, utilize the `slideStyle` callback in the following manner: `slideStyle: (setScroll) => {}`. This empowers you to establish your own scrolling conditions using the `setScroll()` function within the callback. To successfully implement this approach, adhere to the following steps:

1. Enable the `slideStyle` option for your chosen visual style effect.
2. Invoke the callback, passing in the `setScroll` parameter.
3. Within the callback function, you can dynamically update the scroll position, ranging from 0 to the position of the last image.
4. Employ a scroll event listener within this context to keep track of changes in the scrolling behavior. You can select any suitable method, such as GSAP or other libraries.
5. Inside the event listener, utilize the `setScroll` function and provide the parameter `window.scrollY / innerHeight` to obtain the current scroll position relative to the window height. You can customize this calculation as needed, possibly integrating the progress from GSAP or similar methods.
6. By following these steps, you will successfully implement your own personalized scroll-triggering mechanism.

```html
<!-- Here is the code snippet demonstrating this process: -->

<div class="images">
  <img src="image1" />
  <img src="image2" />
  <img src="image3" />
</div>
```

```javascript
Shery.imageEffect(".images", {
  style: 5,
  slideStyle: (setScroll) => {
    window.addEventListener("scroll", () => {
      setScroll(window.scrollY / innerHeight); //Updating the scroll
    });
  },
});
```

By adhering to these instructions, you can create and control your unique scroll-triggered effects in the **Multiple Image Scroll Effect** using the specified callback mechanism.

## Debug Usage

![Debug](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/aayushchouhan24/sheryjs@main/media/debug.png)

To customize any of the 3d effects provided by Shery.js, simply enable debug mode with parameter `{debug:true}` for effects which supports it.

To save/use the tweak from your debug you need to click on `SAVE TO CLIPBOARD` and the paste that config in config parameter.

```html
<img class="img" src="example.img" />
```

```javascript
Shery.imageEffect(".img", {
  style: 3,
  debug: true,
  config: {
    uFrequencyX: { value: 100, range: [0, 100] },
    uFrequencyY: { value: 44.86, range: [0, 100] },
    uFrequencyZ: { value: 100, range: [0, 100] },
    uTime: { value: 37.14299999999965 },
  },
});
```

### Preset Usage

Create your own preset or use someone elses with the help of preset option `{preset:'./presets/wigglewobble.json'}` you can create your own preset with the help of debug panel like :-

1. Enable [debug panel](#debug-usage) for your chosen style effect.
2. Do your customization's in debug panel.
3. Now click on **SAVE TO CLIPBOARD** button in debug panel.
4. Now create an new **_.json_** file.
5. Paste the copied config there.
6. And you created a new preset you can use it later or share it and help community.

```javascript
Shery.imageEffect("img", {
  style: 2,
  preset: "./presets/wigglewobble.json",
});
```

### Callback Usage

Create your own animation or condition for change values of `uniforms`, `meshes`, `camera`, `etc` where uniform are variable which you change from debug panel you can use this by option `setUniforms: (uniforms) => {}` you can console log the uniforms to get list of uniforms and for other attributes you can use option `setAttribute: (attributes) => {}` the variable attributes is an object which  contains :-

```json
 {
   // Geometry of effect
    geometry,

    // 3js Scene
    scene, 

    // 3js Camera
    camera, 

    // WebGL Renderer
    renderer, 

    // Array of uniforms of all elements of given class
    uniforms: [],
     
    // Array of meshes of all elements of given class
    meshes: []  
  }
```

```javascript
Shery.imageEffect('img', {
    style: 2,
    setUniforms: (uniforms) => {
       uniforms.maskVal.value = 3 // Syntax -> uniforms.uniform_name.value = your
    }
})
```

```javascript
Shery.imageEffect('img', {
    style: 2,
    setAttribute: (attributes) => {
       uniforms[0].maskVal.value = 3 
    }
})
```
